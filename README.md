# README

This is an HTML file with associated CSS and image assets that make up a portfolio website. This website is a portfolio of a Full-Stack web developer named Solomon Tegegne. in this project, I have used HTML and CSS to create a website that contains a header, a main section, and a footer. The website is responsive and can be viewed on a variety of devices. and also I have used the flexbox layout to create a responsive layout for the website.
** you can have a better understanding about the framework if u look at the design presentation pdf file inside the assets folder.


## File structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that controls the presentation of the HTML elements.
- `Assets`: The directory that contains the image assets used in the website.
- inside the assets folder there are 2 screenrecording videos that show the different layout of the website on different screen sizes.

## How to use

To use the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The website is responsive and can be viewed on a variety of devices. but i recommend  to launch on a laptop or desktop computer using firefox developer edition browser.

## Additional / Important information

I use links in side portfolio section to link to my other projects but they are not fully functional yet. I will update them as I complete the projects. i just use them to show the functionality of the website. and also all the description inside the 'About me' section is not true. I just use it to show the functionality of the website.
